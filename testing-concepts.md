# Software Testing Concepts and Methodology

## 1. Test Strategy
A test strategy is a high-level document that defines the testing approach for an entire organization or project. It outlines:

- Testing objectives and goals
- Testing scope and methods
- Testing tools and environment requirements
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
- Roles and responsibilities
- Test deliverables

Example:
For a banking application, the test strategy might specify:
- All financial transactions must undergo security testing
- Performance testing is mandatory for all customer-facing modules
- Mobile and web platforms must be tested across multiple devices/browsers
- Automated regression testing for core banking functions
- Daily security scans for vulnerability detection

## 2. Test Plan
A test plan is a detailed document specific to a project or release that outlines:

- Features to be tested
- Testing schedule and timeline
- Resource allocation
- Entry and exit criteria
- Test environment specifications
- Defect tracking process

Example:
For a new fund transfer feature in a banking app:
- Timeline: 4 weeks of testing
- Resources: 2 manual testers, 1 automation engineer
- Environment: Test server with mock payment gateway
- Entry criteria: All APIs are deployed and functional
- Exit criteria: Zero critical defects, 95% test coverage

## 3. Use Cases
Use cases describe specific interactions between users and the system, including:

- Actor (user role)
- Preconditions
- Main flow
- Alternative flows
- Post-conditions

Example:
Use Case: Fund Transfer
- Actor: Bank Customer
- Precondition: User is logged in, has sufficient balance
- Main flow: 
  1. User selects transfer option
  2. Enters recipient details
  3. Enters amount
  4. Confirms transfer
  5. Receives confirmation
- Alternative flow: Insufficient balance warning

## 4. Test Conditions
Test conditions are specific items or requirements that need to be verified:

- Functional requirements
- Business rules
- Data conditions
- Interface requirements
- Performance requirements

Example:
For fund transfer:
- Valid account numbers
- Different currency conversions
- Transaction limits
- Account balance validation
- Transaction history updates

## 5. Test Scenarios
Test scenarios are high-level test cases that cover a specific feature or functionality:

- Business flow
- End-to-end functionality
- User journey testing

Example:
Fund Transfer Scenarios:
- Transfer between own accounts
- Transfer to another bank customer
- International wire transfer
- Scheduled future transfer
- Recurring transfer setup

## 6. Test Cases
Detailed step-by-step procedures with:

- Test case ID
- Description
- Prerequisites
- Test steps
- Expected results
- Actual results
- Pass/Fail status

Example:
Test Case: FT_001 - Domestic Fund Transfer
- Description: Verify successful fund transfer between two domestic accounts
- Prerequisites: 
  * Valid user login
  * Minimum balance of $100
- Steps:
  1. Login to banking app
  2. Select "Transfer Funds"
  3. Enter recipient account
  4. Enter amount $50
  5. Submit transfer
- Expected Result: Transfer successful, balance updated
- Actual Result: [To be filled during execution]
- Status: [To be filled during execution]

## 7. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)
RTM links requirements to test cases and tracks coverage:

- Requirement ID
- Requirement description
- Test case IDs
- Test status
- Defect IDs

Example:
REQ_001: Fund Transfer Feature
- Test Cases: FT_001, FT_002, FT_003
- Coverage: 100%
- Status: In Progress
- Related Defects: DEF_045

## 8. Testing Principles
Key principles include:

- Early testing
- Defect clustering
- Pesticide paradox
- Exhaustive testing is impossible
- Context-dependent testing
- Defect absence fallacy
- Testing shows presence of defects

## 9. Types and Levels of Testing

### Levels:
1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. System Testing
4. Acceptance Testing

### Types:
1. Functional Testing
   - Feature testing
   - Error handling
   - Boundary testing

2. Non-functional Testing
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing
   - Usability testing
   - Compatibility testing

Example Application:
For a fund transfer feature:
- Unit Testing: Test individual methods for amount validation
- Integration Testing: Test interaction between account and transfer modules
- System Testing: End-to-end transfer flow testing
- Acceptance Testing: Business scenarios validation
